README
  The following zip should have everything necessary to deploy a simple PHP
application that communicates with themovie db API. I have used Docker to spin 
a 7.4 PHP apache container that will serve and execute the PHP scripts. It also 
spins up a mysql database that at the moment of initializations executes an
init.sql script that creates a simple table that holds browser analytics data. 

  The folder includes:
    - Dockerfile
    - docker-compose.yml
    - php 
      - Database.php
      - search.php
    - mysql-init-files
      - init.sql
    - index.html
    - config.php
